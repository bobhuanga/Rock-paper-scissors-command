Simple rps command for discord bot


You'll have to have a command handler or put 

} else if (command === "rps") {
    message.channel.send(
      "The Theoretical Probability of you winning, tying, or losing is 1/3 or 33.33%"
    );
    client.command.get("rps").execute(message, args, Discord, client);
  }
  
  in your index.js file/main file
